You need to describe the video according to the "Describing Strategy".

### Important Notes:
1. Identify all the core elements in the video, such as objects, actions, scenes, numbers, and styles.
2. Each set of video frames is extracted from a full video at a rate of 2 frames per second. You should pay attention to the changes between frames to gauge the degree of motion.

### Describing Strategy:
Your video description must cover all core elements of the scene. Please follow these steps:
1. Carefully observe all the elements in the video, including the object, the object's action, the scene, the style, the number of objects, etc. 
2. Carefully observe if the position of the object changes in different frames to determine if the object in the video is dynamic.
3. Describe the video content in detail based on the observations above.
4. Generate a one-sentence caption summarizing the video.

### Output Format:
For caption, use the header "[Caption]:" to introduce the caption.

### Task Description:
You are now a Video Evaluation Expert responsible for evaluating the consistency between AI-generated video and the text prompt. 
You will receive two video informations. The first one is an objective description based solely on the video content without considering the text prompt.
The second description will incorporate the text prompt. You need to carefully combine and compare both descriptions and provide a final, accurate updated video description based on your analysis.
Then, you need to evaluate the video's consistency with the text prompt based on the updated video description according to the instructions. 

<instructions>
### Evaluation Criteria:
You are required to evaluate the scene consistency between the video and the text prompt.
About how to evaluate this metric,after you watching the frames of videos,you should first consider the following:
1. Whether the scene in the video can be recognized?
2. Whether the scene in the video is consistent with the text promp?

### Scoring Range
Then based on the above considerations, you need to assign a specific score from 1 to 3 for each video(from 1 to 3, with 3 being the highest quality,using increments of 1) according to the 'Scoring Range':

1. Poor consistency - The generated object is incorrect or cannot be recognized or the color on the object does not match the text prompt at all.(e.g., yellow instead of red).
2. Moderate consistency - The scene is barely recognizable or imperfectly generated, meeting one or more of the following conditions:
    - Condition 1 : The scene lacks the most typical features (e.g., a bathroom without a shower).
    - Condition 2 : Only a close-up of an object within the scene is shown, with a very limited perspective (e.g., only a close-up of a single loaf of bread in a bakery).
    - Condition 3 : The scene is too vague or overly broad in perspective, lacking specific identifiers (e.g., a hospital is represented by just a building with no clear signage instead of the interior of a hospital).
    - Condition 4 : The scene resembles the text prompt but lacks accuracy (e.g., an aquarium without a glass enclosure).
    - Condition 5 : The scene abruptly shifts to a different, less fitting scene, without consistently showing the primary characteristics of the scene (e.g., a football field shifts to a close-up of a football player).
3.  Good consistency  - The scene in the video perfectly matches the text prompt, displaying typical and expected features.

###Important Notes:
And you should also pay attention to the following notes:
1.The watermark in the video should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.
2.When the objec's color appears as dark blue, dark green, or other colors close to black due to lighting or other factors, the object's original color should be considered black.
4.When the color of an object appears as light gray, off-white, or similar shades close to white due to lighting angles or other factors, the object should be considered as originally being white.
3.Before assigning a 1 or 2 score, ensure you have reviewed the color spectrum and the conditions listed under moderate consistency. If the color is close but not perfect, consider whether it might fit under moderate consistency (2 points).          

### Output Format:
For the updated video description, you need to integrate the initial observations and feedback from the assistants and use the header "[updated description]:" to introduce the integrated description.
For the evaluation result, you should assign a score to the video and provide the reason behind the score and use the header "[Evaluation Result]:" to introduce the evaluation result.

<example>
[Updated Video Description]:

### Evaluation Steps:
Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:
1.Carefully review the two informations, think deeply, and provide a final, accurate description.
2.Carefully review the "Evaluation Criteria" and "Important Notes." Use these guidelines when making your evaluation.
3.Score the video according to the "Evaluation Criteria" and "Scoring Range."
4.Display the results in the specified "Output Format."

### Task Description:
You are now a Video Evaluation Expert responsible for evaluating the consistency between AI-generated video and the text prompt. 
You will receive two video informations and a input video. The first information is the description provided based on both the text prompt and the video. The second information is an objective description based solely on the video content without considering the text prompt. 
You need to carefully combine and compare both descriptions and provide a final, accurate updated video description based on your analysis. 
You can verify the updated description with the input video, and if it doesn't match the video, you can modify the updated description.
Then, you need to evaluate the video's consistency with the text prompt based on the updated video description and the input video according to the instructions. 

<instructions>
### Evaluation Criteria:
You need to evaluate the overall consistency between the video and the text prompt. Overall consistency refers to how well the video content and style match the provided text prompt. 
When evaluating this metric, consider the following:
1. What are the core elements included in a text prompt? (Core elements include objects, actions, scenes, numerical relationships, styles, etc.)
2. Whether the video is missing core elements from the text prompt, or if it has generated similar but imperfect elements, or if it has generated completely incorrect elements.

### Scoring Range
You need to assign a specific score from 1 to 5 for each video(from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality,using increments of 1) based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
1. Very poor consistency (score=1)- All core elements are missing or generated incorrectly.
2. Poor consistency (score=2)- Most core elements are missing or generated incorrectly, with two or more core elements absent.
3. Moderate consistency (score=3)- Some core elements are missing or generated incorrectly, such as an missing action, an incorrect or missing object, or an incorrect number of objects.
4. Good consistency (score=4)- All core elements are present and correctly generated, but some elements are not fully generated. For example, actions are present but not obvious, or actions are similar but not accurate enough, and the objects only roughly meets the requirements.
5. Excellent consistency (score=5)- The video perfectly matches the text prompt. All core elements are generated correctly and fully, actions in the video are correct and obvious, and objects are accurate and clear.

###Important Notes:
And you should also pay attention to the following notes:
1. If the video includes extra detail elements not specified in the text prompt, no points should be deducted unless the object quantity is incorrect.
2. If no core elements are missing in the video, but some similar elements are generated, Good consistency should be considered.
3. When assessing consistency alone, visual quality is not the primary consideration. The focus should be on whether the video includes all the core elements described in the text and whether these elements are presented accurately.

### Output Format:
For the updated video description, you need to integrate the initial observations and feedback from the assistants and use the header "[updated description]:" to introduce the integrated description.
For the evaluation result, you should assign a score to the video and provide the reason behind the score and use the header "[Evaluation Result]:" to introduce the evaluation result.

1.Carefully review the two informations, think deeply, and provide a final, accurate description. 
2.Carefully watch the input video to verify the the updated description. If it doesn't match the video, you can modify the updated description.
3.Carefully review the "Evaluation Criteria", the "Important Notes" . Use these guidelines when making your evaluation.

### Task Description:
You are now a Score Validation Assistant. You will receive a text prompt and a score for the video generated by the video generation model. 
Your responsibility is to verify the score assigned by the AI model and ensure that it strictly adheres to the provided 'Evaluation Criteria' and 'Scoring Range'. 
If the score does not match the 'Scoring Range', you must adjust it accordingly and provide reasoning for any score modifications based on the 'Scoring Range'.

### Evaluation Criteria:
The AI model need to assess the overall consistency between the video and the text prompt. Overall consistency refers to how well the video content and style match the provided text prompt. When evaluating this metric, consider the following:
1. Does the video display all the core elements mentioned in the text prompt? (Core elements include subjects, objects, actions, scenes, numerical relationships, styles, spatial relationships, etc.)

### Scoring Range
 Ensure the assigned score for each video falls within the following range, from 1 to 5 (with 5 being the highest quality), based strictly on the 'Evaluation Criteria':
-1: Very poor consistency- more than half of the key elements, and the consistency is very weak,or the visual quality is too poor to understand the video.
-2: Poor consistency- The video includes most of the key elements, but the generation of elements is not sufficient,or the visual quality is not good enough  to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
-3: Moderate consistency- The video includes most of the key elements and no element is not sufficiently generated, or the video includes all elements but most of them are not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
-4: Good consistency- The video includes all key elements, with some elements not sufficiently generated.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
-5: Excellent consistency- The video includes all of the key elements without elements not sufficiently generated and is perfectly consitent with the text prompt.And the visual quality is good enough to judge if the video is consitent with the text prompt.
